PSM II - Questionaire Deck
=====================
This flash card deck assesses your insight into Scrum theory to prepare yourself for the Professional Scrum Master II online assessment by Scrum.org.

It's all about understanding the Scrum values as a toolbox for the Scrum Master to observe behavior, as a foundation for practices and decision.

----

## How do I pass the PSM II?
> - Take the PSM course by Scrum.org
> - Revise the course material and go over the Scrum Guide again (and again)
> - Your course trainer will probably give you a list of additional reading. Use it
> - If you attend a PSM course, you’ll get a free go at the PSM I. Take it
> - Do the Scrum.org Open Assessment again (and again). It helps to form Scrum muscle memory
> - Create a study group with other PSM II candidates and help each other to revise and study
> - Don’t leave it too long after the PSM course before taking the PSM II assessment. You will start to forget things you learned in the course
> - Read the question. I know, this sounds obvious and yet I, and a colleague, both lost marks because we failed to do this
> - Don’t over-think the question
> - Brush up your exam-techniques. Don’t lose points for silly things
> - Don’t worry about the low score you receive at the end of the assessment,this is normal, as only your multiple-choice questions have been marked (Anecdotal information indicates that a score of between 11% and 18% is normal but it will depend on the number of multiple choice questions you have)
> - Questions do not carry the same number of points, so don’t make any predictions based on the score you got at the end of the assessment
> - If you fail, do NOT give up. Scrum.org will feedback to you on where you can improve. Take time to review this thoroughly then draw up a plan to revise and re-sit the assessment

## Here is a sample PSM II question
One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review.
>*How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism?*
>
>*What would the impact be if some members of the development team were not present?*

-Scrum Support @ [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/Forums/aft/1443)-

## Sample Question

### Bad Answer
*The Sprint Review enables empiricism, because people talk about what was done during the Sprint.*

#### *Why this is a bad answer*
>It does not address the second part of the question, and does not explain how the Sprint Review enables empiricism. It only vaguely describes what is done during the Sprint Review, which should be considered common knowledge for this higher level assessment. 

### Good Answer
*The Sprint Review enables empiricism by proving an opportunity for the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the increment and adapt the backlog. The Sprint Review supports transparency, because everyone can see what has been produced.*
*If only part of development team was present, there would be less transparency. The development team members who were not present lose the opportunity to directly hear the feedback provided during the review. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.*

#### *Why this is a good answer*
>It answers both of the points being raised in the question. It doesn’t include a lot of unnecessary supporting information like describing what a Sprint Review is.
