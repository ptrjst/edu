PSM II - Questionaire Deck
=====================
This flash card deck assesses your insight into Scrum theory to prepare yourself for the Professional Scrum Master II online assessment by Scrum.org.

It's all about understanding the Scrum values as a toolbox for the Scrum Master to observe behavior, as a foundation for practices and decision.

----

## Here is a sample PSM II question
One of the Scrum events is the Sprint Review.
>*How does the Sprint Review enable empiricism?*
>*What would the impact be if some members of the development team were not present?*

-Scrum Support @ Scrum.org-

## Sample Question

### Bad Answer
*The Sprint Review enables empiricism, because people talk about what was done during the Sprint.*

#### *Why this is a bad answer*
>It does not address the second part of the question, and does not explain how the Sprint Review enables empiricism. It only vaguely describes what is done during the Sprint Review, which should be considered common knowledge for this higher level assessment. 

### Good Answer
*The Sprint Review enables empiricism by proving an opportunity for the Scrum Team and the interested stakeholders to inspect the increment and adapt the backlog. The Sprint Review supports transparency, because everyone can see what has been produced.*
*If only part of development team was present, there would be less transparency. The development team members who were not present lose the opportunity to directly hear the feedback provided during the review. Directly hearing from stakeholders increases their understanding of what the stakeholders want.*

#### *Why this is a good answer*
>It answers both of the points being raised in the question. It doesnâ€™t include a lot of unnecessary supporting information like describing what a Sprint Review is.
