contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles,

Definition of Scrum
===================
Scrum (n): A framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems,
while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible
value.

Scrum is:

- Lightweight
- Simple to understand
- Difficult to master

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product
development since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for
building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various
processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product
management and development practices so that you can improve.
The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events,
artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific
purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.
The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts, governing the
relationships and interaction between them. The rules of Scrum are described
throughout the body of this document.
Specific tactics for using the Scrum framework vary and are described elsewhere.
