# Scrum Values
Understanding the Scrum values as a toolbox for the Scrum Master to observe behavior, as a foundation for
practices and decision.

## Commitment
Commit to the team. Commit to quality. Commit to collaborate. Commit to learn. Commit to do the best you can,
every day again. Commit to the Sprint Goal. Commit to be professional. Commit to self-organize. Commit to
excellence. Commit to the agile principles (http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Commit to deliver working
software. Commit to look for improvements. Commit to the Definition of Done. Commit to the Scrum
framework. Commit to deliver Value. Commit to finish work (before starting new work or going into a multitasking
mode). Commit to continuously inspect & adapt. Commit to transparency.

## Focus
Focus on what you know (mind YAGNI – You Ain’t Gonna Need It). Focus on what’s most important. Focus on
what’s most nearby in time. Focus on your work. Focus on the simplest thing that might possibly work.

## Openness
Be transparent. Be open about your work. Be open for people. Be open to collaborate across disciplines and
skills. Be open to collaborate with stakeholders and the wider environment. Be open in sharing feedback.

## Respect
Respect people for their experience and personal background. Respect diversity (it makes you stronger). Respect
different opinions (you can learn from it).

## Courage
Show courage in not building stuff that nobody wants. Show courage to not deliver undone software. Show
courage in sharing all possible information (transparency). Show courage in admitting you are not perfect
(nobody is). Show courage to change direction.

# Assets of a collaborative team
Assets can turn into dysfunctions and grind a team.
The 'team' aspect requires nurturung, cherishing and attention to avoid team atrophy.

“Teams are inherently dysfunctional, as they are made of imperfect human beings.” 
–Patrick Lencioni (The Five Dysfunctions of a Team)

## Trust
* Trust
** Constructive
** Vulenrability
** Room for emotions
** Conviviality
** Safety

* Absence of trust
** Defensive
** Reluctance
** Hallway backbiting
** Muted voices

Live and work together, share experiences, solve problems jointly to overcome an absence of trust. Use models to discover and acknowledge each others’ strengths and weaknesses. Think Myers-Briggs.

## Conflict
* Conflict
** Constructive disagreement
** Passionate engagement
** Meaningful dialogue
** Unfiltered, unguarded opinions
** Most important issues first

* Fear of conflict
** Artificial harmony
** Avoidance
** Silent tension
** Interpersonal attacks
** Indecisiveness

'Built-in-Instability' is a natural characteristic of self-organizing teams facing challenging goals. It is an element of productive tension from which creativity and learning emerges.

- Productive conflict is a time-saver. It speeds up decision, avoids lengthy meetings and repeatedly having to visit the same issues.-

## Commitment
* Commitment
** Disagree and commit
** Buy-in
** Transparency over work
** Collective wisdom utilization
** Clear, opportunistic decisions

* Lack of commitment
** Enforced consensus
** Hidden concerns
** Hesitation
** Inner-team competitiveness
** Feign agreement

-Commitment overrides the need for bureaucracy.-

## Accountability
* Accoutability
** Challenging standards for excellence
** Open agreements
** Clear plans of action
** Mutual chanllenging
** Being accountable to the team

* Avoidance of accountability
** Low standards accepting mediocrity
** Ambiguity
** Politics
** Backroom lobbying
** Accountability vacuum

-‘Accountability’ refers to the willingness of team members to call their peers on their actions, commitment, and behavior with regards to shared goals, values and standards. An accountability vacuum arises when the team leader presents himself as the only source of discipline, causing every team member to look at him to hold others accountable. A leader’s attempted omnipresence tends to create such vacuum.-

## Goals
* Goals
** Shared goals
** Regular measurements
** Transparency
** Willing sacrifices
** Meaningful and controllable objective

* Inattention to golas
** Personal heroism
** Individual credit claims
** Ony Ego
** Status & career first
** Emotional indifferences to achievments

-Results should be controllable. Profit is not a goal, but a result from achieving a goal.-
