PSM II - Learning Deck
======================

This flash card deck provide insight into Scrum Theory to prepare yourself for the _Professional Scrum Master_ online assessment by Scrum.org.

It's all about understanding the Scrum values as a toolbox for the Scrum Master to observe behavior, as a foundation for
practices and decision.

## Scrum Values

### Commitment
Commit to the team. Commit to quality. Commit to collaborate. Commit to learn. Commit to do the best you can,
every day again. Commit to the Sprint Goal. Commit to be professional. Commit to self-organize. Commit to
excellence. Commit to the agile principles (http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Commit to deliver working
software. Commit to look for improvements. Commit to the Definition of Done. Commit to the Scrum
framework. Commit to deliver Value. Commit to finish work (before starting new work or going into a multitasking
mode). Commit to continuously inspect & adapt. Commit to transparency.

### Focus
Focus on what you know (mind YAGNI – You Ain’t Gonna Need It). Focus on what’s most important. Focus on
what’s most nearby in time. Focus on your work. Focus on the simplest thing that might possibly work.

### Openness
Be transparent. Be open about your work. Be open for people. Be open to collaborate across disciplines and
skills. Be open to collaborate with stakeholders and the wider environment. Be open in sharing feedback.

### Respect
Respect people for their experience and personal background. Respect diversity (it makes you stronger). Respect
different opinions (you can learn from it).

### Courage
Show courage in not building stuff that nobody wants. Show courage to not deliver undone software. Show
courage in sharing all possible information (transparency). Show courage in admitting you are not perfect
(nobody is). Show courage to change direction.

## Assets of a collaborative team
Assets can turn into dysfunctions and grind a team.
The 'team' aspect requires nurturung, cherishing and attention to avoid team atrophy.

“Teams are inherently dysfunctional, as they are made of imperfect human beings.” 
–Patrick Lencioni (The Five Dysfunctions of a Team)

## Trust

### Existing Trust
- Constructive
- Vulenrability
- Room for emotions
- Conviviality
- Safety

### Absence of trust
- Defensive
- Reluctance
- Hallway backbiting
- Muted voices

>Live and work together, share experiences, solve problems jointly to overcome an absence of trust. Use models to discover and acknowledge each others’ strengths and weaknesses. Think Myers-Briggs.

## Conflict

### Existing Conflict Culture
- Constructive disagreement
- Passionate engagement
- Meaningful dialogue
- Unfiltered, unguarded opinions
- Most important issues first

### Fear of conflict
- Artificial harmony
- Avoidance
- Silent tension
- Interpersonal attacks
- Indecisiveness

>'Built-in-Instability' is a natural characteristic of self-organizing teams facing challenging goals. It is an element of productive tension from which creativity and learning emerges.

*Productive conflict is a time-saver. It speeds up decision, avoids lengthy meetings and repeatedly having to visit the same issues.*

## Commitment

### Exisiting Commitment
- Disagree and commit
- Buy-in
- Transparency over work
- Collective wisdom utilization
- Clear, opportunistic decisions

### Lack of commitment
- Enforced consensus
- Hidden concerns
- Hesitation
- Inner-team competitiveness
- Feign agreement

*Commitment overrides the need for bureaucracy.*

## Accountability

### Exisiting Accoutability
- Challenging standards for excellence
- Open agreements
- Clear plans of action
- Mutual chanllenging
- Being accountable to the team

### Avoidance of accountability
- Low standards accepting mediocrity
- Ambiguity
- Politics
- Backroom lobbying
- Accountability vacuum

>‘Accountability’ refers to the willingness of team members to call their peers on their actions, commitment, and behavior with regards to shared goals, values and standards. An accountability vacuum arises when the team leader presents himself as the only source of discipline, causing every team member to look at him to hold others accountable. A leader’s attempted omnipresence tends to create such vacuum.

## Goals

### Exisiting Goals
- Shared goals
- Regular measurements
- Transparency
- Willing sacrifices
- Meaningful and controllable objective

### Inattention to goals
- Personal heroism
- Individual credit claims
- Ony Ego
- Status & career first
- Emotional indifferences to achievments

>Results should be controllable. Profit is not a goal, but a result from achieving a goal.

## Scrum Master´s Impact

### Lead by example.
Be the first to be vulnerable, and create an environemnt where it's safe to be vulnerable. Be a living demonstration of the assets, including sincere and immediate apologies when beraking them.

### Create an environment of safety.
Encourage debate, support it and keep it productive. Facilitate conversations using coaching techniques, like open questions.

### Deciplined Decisions
Try to have key decisions made at the end of team meetings, making responsiblility and deadlines clear.

### Learn to read the room.
Be connected without being present.

### Good conflict culture
Remind the team that conflict is good and natural and healthy.

### Show patience.
Find comfort in silence, let the team take action, step in, speak up.

### Restrain for solving.
Reveal, not resolve. Be careful not to try and steer the team towards premature resolution of conflict with the intention to protecting people. Help the team members to learn and develop positive conflict resolution skills.

### Be comfortable with the prospect of a decision turning out not to lead to the anticipated result or effect.

### Caring for people.

### Show low tolerance for organizational impediments.

### Most of these bullets could be in a job description of a Scrum Master
As a take away, people could
use this slide to talk with their boss about the responsibilities of a Scrum Master.

## From Controller to Enabler
>Lyssa Adkins describes following as coaching behavior:
> - Coaching people and teams
> - Be a servant-leader
> - Facilitate teams into high performance
> - Focus on the flow of Value
> - Take it to the team

### Move away from: Coordinating individuals and individual contributors
Move toward: Coaching people in Scrum and positive team behavior by gradually embodying the Scrum values.

### Moveaway from: Provding answers as a subject matter expert
Move toward: Enabling self-organization within Scrum Teams

### Moveaway from: Investing in specific outcomes (budget and scope)
Move toward: Helping Product Owners manage Product Backlogs and work with stakeholders

### Moveaway from: Deadlines
Move toward: Focussing Product Owners on flow and Value

### Moveaway from: Prescribing technical solutions
Move toward: Helping Development Teams understand and exxpand the definition of Done

### Moveaway from: Fixing problems
Move toward: Guiding Development Teams to discover what works best for them

## We have a Product Owner
The benefits an organization gets from Scrum largely depend on how the game us played.
Yes, you do Scrum if you have a Product Owner.

## And you will do even better when the role is fulfilled by:

### A (business) Analyst
Limited benefits. But control is safe, as it remains with IT. However, for many decisions the analyst doesn’t have the answer, needs to revert to the real business responsible, look at the project manager, wait for an external decision like the steering committee.

### A proxy for the business
Slightly better. Control remains with IT (‘Can’t trust business people!’) but with a person more connected to the business. Less delays, less waiting time, less hick-ups.

### A person from the business
Better. Direct availability of functional knowledge and stakeholder expectations. Yet, still much waiting time for decisions by the real authorities.

### A business person with a mandate
Much better. A person authorized to take decisions on the spot, using the Sprint Review to demonstrate results to stakeholders.

### A mini-CEO
a business person with full responsibility over the product. They don’t come much better than this.

## We have a Definition of Done
The benefits an organization gets from Scrum largely depend on how the game us played.
Yes, you do Scrum if you have a definition of Done.

## And you will do even better when the definition of Done reflects ‘releasable’ ànd that work can be done in the Sprint (not after a Sprint has finished):

### Development
essential, but hardly enough. Only the start. Without development, no progress as there can’t be working software.

### Test
all testing is done within the Sprint, requiring testing skills in the Development Team. Testing is needed at a unit and a functional level. It does help additionally if the work can be automated and is done progressively in the Sprint, not just toward the end of the Sprint.

### Integrate
All integration, regression and alike testing is done in the Sprint, and across multiple teams working on the same product. It does help additionally if the work can be automated and is done progressively in the Sprint, not just toward the end of the Sprint.

### QA
All organizational guidelines for quality are available and the Development Team has the skills, access and mandate to perform the work in the Sprint. It does help additionally if the work can be automated and is done progressively in the Sprint, not just toward the end of the Sprint.

### Release
all work to prepare for an actual release (like traditional stabilization work) is performed in the Sprint. It does help additionally if the work can be automated and is done progressively in the Sprint, not just toward the end of the Sprint.

## We are a team
The benefits an organization gets from Scrum largely depend on how the game us played.
Yes, you do Scrum if you have a Scrum Team, including a Product Owner, Development Team and
Scrum Master.

## And you will do even better when the team really collaborates

### A team gets formed to start.
It’s merely bringing a group of people together. Most are in
observing mode. Formal arrangements and agreements get made, possibly including team
agreements, engineering standards, a definition of Done, team values, meeting timings.

### A team goes through some storms ...
... as they get to know each other. They build a sense of trust.

### The group of people keeps jelling.
The whole becomes equal to the sum of the parts. They cooperate, with with each other, align their individual work with the work of the others.

### The team knows each other, ...
... has grown confidence in understanding each other’s remarks, stop taking comments personally. They develop shared goals and show commitment to the team and these shared objectives. Individual benefits are being sacrificed for the good of the whole.

### The team has become a unit.
Focus is on the whole. They have passionate debates, engage on opposing ideas, look for the best possible outcome and are proud to be part of the group.
